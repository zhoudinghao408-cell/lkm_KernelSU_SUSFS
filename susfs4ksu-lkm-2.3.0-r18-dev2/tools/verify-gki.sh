# It answers, with measurements rather than assertions:
#   * does the module load at all on this kernel (on 6.1+ a wrong hook prototype is a CFI
#     panic, not a warning - if the phone reboots here, that IS the result: see below)
#   * did the 13 hooks land as the FIRST node of their lists, ahead of SELinux
#   * do they actually run (counters move on a non-root probe)
#   * is a registered entry absent from a LISTING as well, not just from stat() - the name
#     layer is a separate kretprobe and it died silently on 6.1 while stat() kept answering
#     ENOENT, so the two layers are checked separately
#   * is everything they hide still hidden, and is an ordinary rule still app-only
#   * does anything alarm across unload/reload cycles
#   * the 6.1+ VMA walk (maple tree) counters, if a map rule is armed
#
# Everything goes to $LOG as well as to stdout, so you can send that one file back.
#
# IF THE PHONE REBOOTS / GOES BLACK DURING THE LOAD: that is the answer for kCFI and it
# needs no script.  Power it on and collect:
#   adb shell "su -c 'cat /sys/fs/pstore/console-ramoops-0 2>/dev/null | tail -80'"
# plus the .ko you used.  Do not retry blindly.
#
# NOTE: the script unloads and reloads the module several times, so any RUNTIME
# configuration you had (sus_path rules, mount prefixes, the mount hiding switch) is gone
# afterwards.  It restores the mount prefix list and the hiding switch; re-add your own
# sus_path rules yourself (they are listed by `cat /proc/susfs_path` before you start).
#
# Options:
#   --ko <path>       module to test           (default /data/adb/loader/susfs_guard_lkm.ko)
#   --loader <path>   userspace loader         (default /data/local/tmp/susfs_insmod)
#   --map-rule <path> add a sus_map rule for a real .so to arm the VMA-walk counters
#   --cycles <n>      unload/reload cycles     (default 3)
#   --no-restore      leave the module unloaded at the end
