 * sus_path.c - SUSFS SUS_PATH for the LKM, in two independent layers.
 *
 * Upstream sets AS_FLAGS_SUS_PATH on inode->i_mapping, skips the entry inside
 * filldir64() (fs/readdir.c) and hides it from path-based access by patching
 * fs/namei.c (link_path_walk returns -ENOENT; __lookup_slow/lookup_open redo the
 * lookup with the fake qstr "..5.u.S").  This LKM can touch neither - filldir64 is
 * static and LTO-inlined, namei.c is compiled into the kernel - so it reproduces
 * both effects: the getdents64 buffer is rewritten on return (layer 1, by (dev,
 * ino)), and two LSM hooks answer registered inodes with -ENOENT (layer 2:
 * inode_getattr for stat/fstatat/statx, inode_permission for
 * open/exec/chmod/truncate/...).
 *
 * Matching mirrors upstream: exact inode identity (not name substrings), any number
 * of registered paths, hidden wherever that inode is reached ('..', '//', relative
 * paths, symlinks, hard links, /proc/self/root/...), and the upstream gate - app
 * processes only and never a file owned by the caller (sus_path_gate_ok;
 * hide_from_apps=0 disables the gate for a root shell).  A path registered before it
 * exists is kept and hidden once it appears, upstream's CMD_SUSFS_ADD_SUS_PATH_LOOP /
 * LH_SUS_PATH_LOOP behaviour (sus_path_resolve_pending()).
 *
 * Upstream's FUSE_SUPER_MAGIC branch (susfs.c:71-84, :151-166, :195-212) has no
 * equivalent here on purpose - see the note above sus_path_inode_hidden().

/* WHICH NAME TO PROBE, and why it is a list rather than one string.

 * static __se_sys##name (one caller) and static inline __do_sys##name (one caller in the same TU,
 * so clang may inline it away and leave NO symbol); COMPAT_SYSCALL_DEFINEx is the same shape
 * under the compat spelling.
 * MEASURED on the 6.1 device: registering "__do_sys_getdents64" and "__do_compat_sys_getdents"
 * both came back -ENOENT (kallsyms_lookup_name() found no such symbol), which left the dirent
 * layer unarmed there.  The old name still works on the 5.15 device this module is tested on only
 * because that kernel is a vendor build without LTO - and inlining needs no LTO: a single-caller
 * `static inline` is inlined on its own; gki_defconfig also carries CONFIG_LTO_CLANG_FULL=y on
 * android12-5.10 and android13-5.15 (6.1/6.6 have no LTO setting at all), so __do_* is not a name
 * to depend on in any stock GKI build of these releases.
 * So the wrapper is tried FIRST - the only name guaranteed to exist, and arming it on 5.15
 * exercises the exact code path 6.1/6.6 will use (the regs-pointer argument style), which makes
 * the hardware check worth something for the releases that cannot be tested from here.  The
 * direct-style names stay as fallbacks; __se_* is last, because a name that survives only while
 * its single caller was not inlined is the least likely.  filldir/filldir64 are static on every
 * one of these releases (`static bool` on 6.1/6.6, `static int` on 5.10/5.15, fs/readdir.c), so
 * no probe is placed on them either. */

 * installed that upstream would have rejected.
