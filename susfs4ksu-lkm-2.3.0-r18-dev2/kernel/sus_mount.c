 * sus_mount.c - hide KSU mounts from /proc/mounts and /proc/mountinfo.
 *
 * Upstream SUSFS skips a mount line when r->mnt_id >= DEFAULT_KSU_MNT_ID, and
 * (patch:1561-1585) installs those show functions only for NON-ksu domains
 * (!susfs_is_current_ksu_domain() in mounts_open()/mountinfo_open()/mountstats_open()),
 * so the su/ksu domain keeps seeing its own mounts (zygisk in post-fs-data and ksud
 * break otherwise).  The stock show functions are static but sit behind proc_ops function
 * pointers, so they are NOT LTO-inlined and stay kprobe-able (verified in kallsyms); the
 * LKM hooks all three with a kprobe pre_handler and returns early (regs->pc = x30) for a
 * KSU-range id, under the same domain gate.  struct mount / real_mount() come from the
 * private fs/mount.h (its includes are all public headers, so -I$(srctree)/fs is enough).
 *
 * HOW THE ID RANGE IS PRODUCED: upstream ADDS an allocator
 * (susfs_alloc_non_unshare_ksu_vfsmnt(): ida_alloc_min(&mnt_id_ida,
 * DEFAULT_KSU_MNT_ID, GFP_KERNEL), patch:676-693) and SWAPS THE CALL SITES in
 * vfs_create_mount()/clone_mnt() (patch:764, 800); mnt_alloc_id() itself is never
 * patched.  This LKM patches no kernel text, so the stock allocator (plain ida_alloc,
 * smallest free id) kept handing out small ids - measured on device: 91..39693 - and the
 * fixed 2e9 threshold could never match, i.e. the feature was 100% OFF.
 * sus_mount_mark_ksu_mounts() therefore walks the current namespace at enable time (and
 * at load) and gives every KSU-looking mount a REAL id from the release's own allocator:
 * < 6.18 ida_alloc_range(&mnt_id_ida, DEFAULT_KSU_MNT_ID, INT_MAX - 1, GFP_KERNEL);
 * >= 6.18 __xa_alloc(&mnt_id_xa, &id, NULL, XA_LIMIT(DEFAULT_KSU_MNT_ID, INT_MAX - 1),
 * GFP_KERNEL) under xa_lock().
 *
 * A hand-made id is not an option: mnt_free_id() gives the id back to that same
 * allocator when the mount finally goes away (ida_free(), fs/namespace.c:251 on 6.12;
 * xa_erase(), :242 on 6.18), so an invented number makes lib/idr.c:523-525 fire
 * WARN(1, "ida_free called for id=%d which is not allocated.") plus a stack dump on
 * umount - exactly the trace a root detector greps for.  Upstream is under the same
 * constraint and short-circuits the free for its fake ids (patch:582-588); mnt_free_id()
 * is static + LTO-inlined here, so it cannot be patched.  6.18's erase is by index with
 * no such check (so the WARN is a < 6.18 concern); what both share is that the id must
 * not be one the allocator can hand to another mount.  Degradation is fail-closed: unless
 * ALL of the release's allocator symbols are reachable nothing is marked, min_mnt_id
 * stays false, and each missing piece is named in a pr_warn - on 6.18 the loader counts
 * as a source (see the allocator state below).
 *
 * A mount is one of ours when mnt_devname contains "/data/adb/" (KSU/module bind mounts)
 * or the mount POINT - d_path() of {mnt, mnt_root}, the path show_mountinfo() prints - is
 * under /data/adb (catches meta-overlayfs, whose source is /dev/block/loopNN).  Marked ids
 * are never restored on disable, matching upstream, where an id is assigned once at mount
 * time and stays for the mount's lifetime.
 *
 * IDENTITY, not a wider scan: KernelSU mounts into the ZYGOTE's namespace, the one every
 * app is forked into, and the same filesystem is a different mount OBJECT there, with an
 * id of its own - measured on this device: the meta-overlayfs mount is id 2000000000 in
 * the init namespace and id 1111 in the zygote's.  Marking is what creates the big id, so
 * it can only cover namespaces that already existed, and the id test alone then hid the
 * line in one view while the app's own mount table - the one a checker reads - still
 * showed it.  Sweeping every namespace from the task list would mean walking another
 * namespace's mount list, which a foreign namespace mutates while we walk it; instead the
 * scan remembers the mount's identity (superblock device + root inode, plus a path-shaped
 * source string) and the hide hooks accept identity as well as a KSU-range id, learning
 * an id into the id -> shown-id mapping when they hide by identity.
 *
 * Known blind spots (see AUDIT_FINDINGS.md B10): overlayfs mounts KernelSU places on
 * /system have d_path "/system" and mnt_devname "overlay", so they are NOT recognised
 * (only intercepting vfs_create_mount()/clone_mnt() by su domain would catch those); and
 * only the enabling process's namespace is scanned - one cloned later gets fresh small ids
 * from the stock allocator (upstream covers that in clone_mnt() with CL_COPY_MNT_NS,
 * patch:789-810).

/* ---- "is this mount one of ours", by IDENTITY and not only by id ----
 *
 * The id test is a property of ONE mount object in ONE namespace, and the id only
 * exists because the marking scan put it there: a KSU mount inside the app/zygote
 * namespace carries whatever id the stock allocator gave it (measured: the
 * meta-overlayfs mount is 2000000000 in the init namespace and 1111 in the
 * zygote's), so the id test hid the line in one view and left it in the other - the
 * app's own mount table, the one a checker reads.
 *
 * So the scan remembers what survives a namespace boundary (the mount OBJECT does not, its
 * filesystem does): s_dev + root ino, exact and cheap, because the root dentry is shared by
 * every mount of a superblock and a second tmpfs has its own root inode.  The NUMBER is
 * stored, not the dentry pointer: a held pointer would need dget() - pinning dentry and inode
 * past the superblock's shutdown, measured: rmmod of that build dput()'d it and panicked in
 * shmem_evict_inode, "Oops: Fatal exception" - or be used unlocked after the mount is gone.
 * mnt_devname is compared only when it is a path (starts with '/'), so a recorded
 * "tmpfs"/"overlay" cannot hide every mount of that kind.
 *
 * Only mounts the scan ACCEPTS are recorded, so this never widens into "hide anything that
 * looks similar".  A record is valid only while its filesystem is mounted, and its keys are
 * reusable: measured, a tmpfs mounted/recorded/unmounted by this test left s_dev 0:304 and
 * root inode 1 behind and the very next tmpfs got both, i.e. a stale record hid an unrelated
 * filesystem - hence the kprobe on generic_shutdown_super() that drops every record whose
 * s_dev is going away. */

 * Hiding still works (identity is namespace independent), but the fdinfo/statx face needs
 * an id, and the table only learns one when somebody READS a mount table: a process that
 * opens a file in the new namespace and reads /proc/self/fdinfo/N first gets an id its own
 * mountinfo does not list (measured: mnt_id=29127, listed_in_my_mountinfo=0) until the
 * first mount-table read makes it consistent (29117, listed=1).  Upstream assigns the big
 * id at mount creation, so its copy is marked from the start.
 *
 * On < 6.12 that tree is walked right here (see sus_mount_learn_ns below).  On >= 6.12 it
 * is NOT walked here, because the mount collection is an rb-tree that may only be walked
 * under namespace_sem - a sleeping rwsem this probe cannot take with preemption disabled -
 * and "the namespace is fresh, so nothing else can touch it" is not a proof about that
 * tree: copy_mnt_ns() passes neither CL_PRIVATE nor CL_SLAVE, so the copy of a SHARED
 * mount stays a propagation peer, and another task can insert into the very tree we would
 * be walking (under namespace_sem alone).  The >= 6.12 probe therefore only RECORDS the
 * namespace; a work item walks it later in process context under namespace_sem for read,
 * exactly like the marking scan, with the same refuse-and-log when that lock cannot be
 * resolved.  This trap once panicked the device when it walked a live namespace, and the
 * flags check below (no CLONE_NEWNS -> the CURRENT namespace, the plain fork path) is what

 * out of the kernel's own list readers and of every list mutation that takes it, while the
 * iteration bound covers the one that does not (umount_tree()'s list_del_init under
 * namespace_sem) and rcu_read_lock keeps a mount being torn down alive (they are freed
 * through call_rcu() in cleanup_mnt()) so a stale pointer cannot be reused under us.
 *
 * ID ALLOCATION happens BEFORE the lock, in a small batch and outside the rcu_read_lock() of
 * the walk: the allocator may sleep (ida_alloc_range() with GFP_KERNEL may allocate a radix
 * node; on >= 6.18 __xa_alloc() drops and retakes the xarray lock for the same reason) and
 * the loop ends up with a spinlock held on < 6.12 and under rcu_read_lock() on >= 6.12.  An
 * unused batch is handed back to the same allocator afterwards, so the pairing the kernel
 * expects stays intact.
 *
 * >= 6.12 replaces all of that with namespace_sem plus an rb-tree (see SUS_MOUNT_ITER_FOR):
 * the lock is taken first because it may sleep, and the "still there" guarantee comes from
 * holding it, not from RCU.  The id source is version-split too (mnt_id_ida < 6.18,
 * mnt_id_xa >= 6.18, documented at the allocator state above). */
